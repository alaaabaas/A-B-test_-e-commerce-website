# A-B-test_e-commerce-website
The goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
 
 
 
**hypotheses**:



null hypotheses : The new page is equal or less in its impact on conversion actions 𝑝𝑛𝑒𝑤 =< 𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑑



alternative hypotheses: the new page performs better than the old page in increasing conversions 𝑝𝑛𝑒𝑤 > 𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑑

**Results**


If the p-value <0.01 then there exists an evidence that the new page is statistically different from the old page
